Hi guys, I have made demo application for ComplexRecyclerView in Kotlin. This is the open project for any contributer who want to improve something here.

This Sample show list of users along with their items with pagination and many other things.
offset : Position where you need to start your users.
limit: number of users you want to fetch in single hit.

1. User items images are square.
2. Horizontal and vertical spacings between every image are equal.
3. If items are even, then display them 2 in each row.
4. If items are odd, display the first one to span the full row, and show the remaining spanning 2 in each row.
5. Implemented pagination.

It usage of following libraries:

* [Retrofit2] for REST API.

* [RX java] for background process and Retrofit integration.

* [Dagger2] for dependency injection.

* [Glide] for image loading.

* [Fabric] for crashlytics.

* [Timber] for logging.

It uses MVP (Model View Presenter) pattern. MVP is a derivative from the well known MVC (Model View Controller), which for a while now is gaining importance in the development of Android applications.This project also contains basic utility classes required for day to day programming.
